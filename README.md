not all jokes included for convenience

## Art and Pictures

Both logos (text logo and animetion logo) were drawn by me. All backgrounds for jokes were politely downloaded from pinterest. Animations were taken from codepen.io website, which I am very thankfull to.

Unfortunately another page for "Drop it here" button was not implemented, i genuinely enjoyed creating this website though. The second i saw the additional assignment on moodle i run to my sketchbook to draw my ideas for this project. the website is raw and a bit plain but i learnt a lot, and finally managed creating mobile version (which was a complete fail at first). 

All pinterest pictures were manually cropped because they were not pngs (very unfortunate) but it was a great brake between code writing sessions. Almost felt like a hackathon honestly.
